## Requirements

-Your repo tracker should have an input for users to give their GitHub username
-After submitting their username, use the GitHub API to retrieve that user's list of repos
-When selecting a repo, a User should be shown some data about that repo eg. issue count, stargazers, forks etc.
NB: This usage of the GitHub API does not require authentication
